# People Web API
.Net Core 3.1 Web API running on Linux docker with repository pattern on mssql database, jwt login, in-memory unit tests and docker integration tests.

## JWT
UserName and password for JWT token is set to "test" for purpose of simplicity in this example.

## Docker
Run by <code>docker-compose -f "docker-compose.yml" up -d --build</code> command to build and run the ASP.NET Core Web API in container with SQL Server running separately in another container with set volume. <code>"DefaultConnection": "Server=db;Database=master;User=sa;Password=Your_password123;"</code>

## IISExpres
For running it locally on IISExpress change DefaultConnection in appsettings.json file to localDb.
<code>"DefaultConnection": "Server=(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb;Database=People;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true"</code>

## Integration testing with docker-compose
Run integration tests only with script, in Visual Studio as classic unit tests it will fail.

### The `run-integration-tests.bat` file
This script will launch the `docker-compose` command to build and run the ASP.NET Core and the integration test projects in a container. As described by the `docker-compose-   integrationtests.yml` file, here's the hierearchy of containers:
 * The integration test project
   * depends upon the webapi container
     * which depends upon a Sql Server for Linux container


 Integration tests will run as soon as the two containers have been created and message will appear in the output.

 Containers are stopped and the end and recreated at each execution of the script, so that test results can be deterministic.
